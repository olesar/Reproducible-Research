Sometimes we can't predict what is better on some stage of the history, By the time of 'Ottepel' it was only possible to build faceless condominiums to give people some place to live, Even nowadays the gouvernement approves projects of the same individuality and beautifulness leves as ones of Khruschevkas, This is caused by a fast growth of the cities, When the city population increase so fast so many people just can't rent a flat the only possible decision is to build more and more quikly built big condominiums and not to think about their exterior a lot, It is also relevant for the cases of hurricaines and other unexpected nature cruelties when people just lose their houses, But sometimes this kind of building is used simply to gain more money from less work; because even though those buildings do not require a lot of time and resources to be produced and built; a flat in one of faceless buildings costs a lot of money, I; personally; do not think that the only purpose of buildings is to live in, The atmosphere that creates the building itself is an important thing to think about being an architect, The house should be a home; so why don't produce beautiful condominiums instead of grey ones to make its habitants' lives better? The appearance of the building is the main thing that creates an appearance of the entire quarter, This is also why the condos should be bright and looking like a piece of art, The new quarters appearance can create a new thinking models for people that live in, So; architects can surely be avare only about a purpose of a building; not about its look; but it will create a depressed; strict world, No one wants to live in such a dark place, 	2249	393	350+

Actually; there is no doubt; that communication between girls a boys is essential, But we are talking not about the importance of their privale relations, We are trying to consider this question from the educational point of view, Let's emagine a situation: an equal number of male a female students in the subject, What it leads to? Males try to attract girls attention a vise-revsa, Females try to do the same, However; if on the subject; there is no opposite sex; the educational level would be much higher, We can predict; that both sexes woud concern only about their study, On the other hand; as I've already pointed out; the communication is an essentrial skill; which every student should imrove; but it doesn't mean; that this necessary skill should be practised at university, Most students have enough free time to do this with no destroy of studing, I afirm; that the situation of disproportion of Females 2 males in universities should be changed; and; moreover; in every subject should appear only males or only females, This opinion could be presented on the example of special universities for males or females; which are wide spread in an English speaking counties a an educational level there is much higher; than in average university, As a consiquence; I'd like to note; that the question of sexes disproportion in universities is strill open; but; as for me; this situation should be changed; in the way; of the whole ie section of mixed sexes universities,	1711	290	250+

Not so many people give the right answer for this question, But some persons consider that the institutes should accept the equal amount of girls and boys in every faculty, They believe it to be more effective for educational process, But is it really so? Of course; there is the huge number of people who are against this statement, First of all; it should be noticed that all statutes of the international law prohibit the discrimination in this sphere, Secondly; there are a lot of subjects which demand only female or only male (for example: nursury; some kinds of medicine and policy), It's really important to take only girls or boys there because of the specific requarements (mental or phychological characteristics for instanse), It is impossible to imagine a girl who drives a train or a huge submarine, That's why these faculty accept only male, But on the other hand there are a lot of subjects which suit for girls and boys both: jurisprudence; economics; politics and so on in the universities, And; of course; it is really interesting and easy then the amount of male female is equal, For example; my group has 12 boys and 12 girls - it is very convinient for some teachers to make us to different small groups for pojects or tests and so on, To sum it up I can say that I completely agree with the statement that the universities should not accept the strong established member of students (equal amount of male and female), It should be resolved occasionally!	1552	271	250+

In my opinion; should not and I have two arguments to prove my position, At the first; biologically in society we have more womans than mans, A s a result; the proportion of the sexes of students is unequal, It means that if universities will accept equal numbers of males and females; many females will be not accepted to the courses; because their number is bigger, It will be an unfair situation - universities should accept students to study by their possibilities and skills; but not by their sex, Secondly; some courses and subjects have gender specialization, In the most cases; mechanics are mans; and haicuters and cookers are womans, University can't find equal numbers of students of both sexes; whose want to get a degree in; for example; car construction, Obviously; between these students will be more males; than females, It will lead us to unfair problem too - some male students will be not accepted to this course only because there will be not avaliable places for student of this gender, Finally; I should summarise my arguments, If universities will introduce the politic of accepting to courses equal numbers of males and females; it will lead us to unfair situations because of two facts, First; society have more womans than mans, And second; in the cause of the gender stereotypes; studens of certain sexes will avoid certain courses; for example - womans prefer to enter the cooking course more than car mechanics,	1743	293	250+

Some part of man thinks that the growths of sport appliances will help, It is not a secrete; that all sportsmen are strong and healthy; it is a good example, Also; if people will have possibility to do sport more; they will spend less time on bad habbits, And finally; when people do sport at clubs; they are aimed at one goal - to be healthy and smart; so they don't think about their illnesses, However; there are another part of people who is against the first opinion, They consider that to increase public health; exist other methods; and they are for them; cause they will help people more, For example; medicines influence peoples' health faster, One more: frequent visiting to doctors - to control the level of health; that prevent you of being sick, Also; some procedures that are done in the hospital, To take into consideration both opinions; I should say that there are a lot of methods of improving public health; however; firstly; people must not think always about headache; smoothache,,, on the contrary they should think and imagine that they are getting healthier, Secondly; sport activities are very important; therefore there will be an increase in sport appliances for a public: fitness clubs; more facilities at the street and so on,,, Moreover; there is alternative medicine: acupuncthurism; therapism; herbalism; that are approved make brilliant effect on people existance, To sum everything up; there are plenty of ways of achieving good health, Of course; for a public it is very necessary government's support and programms; cause we are yet at pressure of government policy,	1843	311	300+

In my opinion that there are many organizations in the country; but public health have not peak level and its increasing not improve, There are two main reasons why it could be argued that public health cannot improve by rising the number of sports facilities, Firstly; person should understaend problems of itself health, But if he or she is health; increasing the number facilities cannot help, Second; many schools and university rising the number lesson of phisics education for children, But it was not effectly, However; Russian in 2014 organisating winter Olimpic and Para Olimpic Games and as statistic datas shows; quantaty people; who want be health increase, And Russian Federation solve building sport objects in the others cities of country, In conclusion; while there are some reasons to believe that increasing the number sports complecs and other facilities help people make health best; but my own view is that it nit help more quantati people,	1134	183	150+

I think that the government should give artists enough freedom; but sometimes it also can restrict their activities to save the public order in the country, Uncontrolled freedom can be the illness of our society; time to time we should restrict it; but doing it very carefully; with the understanding of the situation not only in your country; but also in the world,	1828	306	300+

The idea of making university equal - for boys and girls? Sounds good, But I don't like the way; how authors want to make it real, On the one hand - when in class teacher had the same proportion of both sex - it's a good posibility to work with gender differences in different areas of science - because there will be a lot of opinions from both sides, But on the other hand; - which one is scary me more - how in our real life universities will try to do this, Maybe they will make a rough rools for student; maybe someone won't go to the class he wants - because there; for example; will be enough boys, The main aid if universities should be quality of the education they made not the numbers of female (or male) students at the course, And for this equity they should make good options and good atmosphere for learning and studing both sides of the medal - female and male, That missunderstanding is very important - not every teacher can think that way, Maybe someone has different opinion because if his historical country development - or religion; or smth else, It shouldn't be a problem, So; because of that reasons; I can't agree with the statement - idea is good; but not quite good in reality situation, In conclusion I would like to say that now some big and famous universities have a problem with gender stereotypes - maybe some girl wants to have military education - and for her it's impossible, Or there is an another situation - when a male student wants to be a designer; but he will be the only man in this group because of the speciality, So; to solve these problems with gender character; university should do something else exept making the numbers equal; and try a few different ways - like making a non - gender ads or organize a special help for not ordinary students,	1923	352	350+

Firstly; it should be noticed that the international companies share their products; services and open largest possibilities, These companies move the customers on the side, For example; if the Coca-Cola companie opens their offices in Nigeria; employs certain local habitants and the prices for their production will have been moved to more comfortable; then Coca-Cola companie become more popular in the world; because they support poor countries, Secondly; against this point of view there is a lot of disagreements, Offices in developing countries could have a lot of finances problem, If big companie move to the little developing country; this companie will jump in the "finance hole" and this sharing will become a crysis for officers in these countries, Like wise employing people might lose their jobs and in this case products of such an international companies should lose their benefits by customers, Overall; I can say; that this way for business could be really dangerous but it also could win this struggle, Population of poor countries could love this services and; in the future; when countries will become one big customers group; which will be ready pay any price to buy products from the companie then has supported, It is really discussing question and in my opinion it will be really hard to find an answer,	1552	256	250+

On the one hand; it is a reasonable statement; that such a big amount of air travel we have nowadays is not that necessery and can be cancelled by the government, Aspecially; when we talk about some private business trips, People who use private plains can travel with other passengers by first class for example, Besides; we do not need to travel by plain if we can do it by train, There are such trips as Moscow - St Pitesberg; which people do not always should make by plain, On the other hand; talking about pollution of the air and global warming; we must understend that air travel is not the most important problem, There are lots of things which influence pollution much more then air travels, We should think about resolving such problems as lots of cars; factor and so on first; and not about prohibiting air travels, I do not think that after canceling some private business travel the problem will become less, In conclusion; I would like to say that it is a very important problem and everybody can see it from different sides, However; before making any decision we should carefully study all the ditails; all pros and cons of this deal, It is a really important thing for people to be able to travel by plain; that is why we should do everything not to let us to loos this opportunity,	1636	295	250+

Weren't they some kind of a voice of generation common symbol? Yes; they were, And was imagine what would happen; if access to their art were hardly restricted; if so-called pirates were punished for such dynamic "illegal" sharing? Would you support such restrictions? Secondly; as for as I'm concerned; every artist wants his work to be seen and valued, It is not about money; but about self-expression; self-manifestation if you want to call it 10, And Internet; free sharing; pirates - all mentioned allows creators directly communicate with their potential (and non-potential) authority; with those who could understand them, Capitalist logic of investments and incomes do not work in such case musical label; midue-concernt do act in a role of giant parazyte, To conclude; I'll say that free share is a mechanism which helps not only public; but to an author as well, It their needs and ambitions; perfectly and encourages development dynamic of both of them, So if we must choose between general good and pragmatic material interests of firms and companies; I will undoubtly choose the first option,	1860	305	300+

Moreover; copying and sharing programmes; music and films is prohibited by the law, It is obvious that people who do this dirty work are need to be found and punished, By the way; there is another point of view, Everybody loves watch films and listen to the music as it makes people happy in dayly routine and sometimes even give power to do another step, Nevertheless; not all of them can get it because of low income, So; copies in the Internet is the only way to touch this, Another people live in such special areas, Where modern foreign film industry; for example; is prohibited by the goverment as in some east countries, To sum up; it is evident that such copying of information is illegal activity as people who produce all this music and films have great harm,	1538	276	250+

I strongly believe; that attitude and relationships between teachers and pupils should be changed; particularly in Russia, Teachers in Russia are accept as a minor; that is why pupils are afraid of them and even cannot talk about something after school time, Furthermore; the youth behave this way because of lack of some interests, It means; that they should find something that will give them positive feelings; something that can unburden the interest, I do believe; that sport can solve this problem; because when you do this you are focused only on this deal and can relax and get rid of bad things from your mind, To sum up; I would like to add; that actually all these bad things depend on a person, Some people have strong spirit; the feeling of honesty and they fight with it well,	1866	335	300+

In adiition; it's also important to realise that space exploration stimulate the science and the manufacturing developing; so it's not just a waste of money and time, Many people have sense of all their live in building spaceships and another technical equipment for space flights and they get money for it, To conclude; I would like to say that goverments and sponsors should find a balance in their spends between space and actual problems around them such as society and environment, They should find a balance between dream and reality, Only then the humanity can reach a harmony,	1770	302	300+

How can we influence on solving this problem? First; we should remember that we responsible for taking care of ourselves and we should control our habbits which can decrease our health, If we know that long-term using can lead to some problems; we should use it less even if we do not want to do it, Second; we should always read instructions from creators of technology in order to know all possible cases and the ways of their solving, Each technology has its own warning; so we always may get to know activities we should not or must not to do, Also; if it can decrease health; we will learn if from instruction, The third argument is we can switch to eco innocations, Most of them created with purpose not to damage the environment and not to decrease people's health, Technological progress allows us buy more and more safety things; which have no bad influence on people, We should focus on this area as investors; developers; creators or customers, Thus; technology may has bad influence on our health; but it is only our responsibility to control the number of influence, We should be solution oriented people if we want to stop it, Modern world gives us opportunity to make a right choise or create something new, So if we want to solve this problem; we will do it,	1611	285	250+

Decreasing import gives us safe and stable future; where country can avoid global economical problem, On the other side; export gives country money (not only that because gold is the way too) and make the nation rich, By the way we should avoid corruption,	1500	257	250+

Of course; the first one is that people in modern societies have the high risk of have a big weight, They can be fat; because they didn't have time to doing sports and to improve their health by morning exercise; for example; or by running, They think that the better way to spend time in the morning is watching TW or spent time in sociasl medias, Second problem is that some people so attracted by their work; that when they have been ill; they didn't want to have a normal help by doctors and didn't go to the hospital, They think; that some medicaments; which are product of modern technology; can help to feeling themselves better, But it is not true think always, There is no doubt; that the both problems can be reduced; first of all; goverment and media should help to every person to knowing about simple rules of health care, For instance; peoples should know; that they should think about their weight and sometimes do some exercise, Maybe; once they can go to the work not by a transport; but by a cycles, Of course; they didn't think; that all of their treatments can leave; because tablets, In conclusion; there are much more number of health problem, Also; during the time, That number will increasing,	1553	272	250+

Despite there being a lot of debates about the opportunity of using any drugs in order to increase sport skills; sportsmen should stay carefull; because such measures might destroy their health, It is true for any kind of drugs: legal or illegal, As for the latter; I strongly believe that its using by professional sportsmen is the worse way to gain success, That is why it might be necessary to banned such sportsmen from competing not only for 2 or 3 years; but for the rest of life,	1771	321	300+

Building; no matter if it's for real use or just aesthetical pleasure; requires lots of resources, Money; time; materials; human forces are all significant for producing building, Even though financial side of the problem might be the key to prefer useful things rather than beautiful ones; the architects continue creating huge pieces of art that are basically just city decorations, Some examples those kind of buildings might be the Eiffel Tower; Big Ben; enormous monuments and arches of triumph, Some other buildings could have taken less financing being less decorated, It's not really clear how golden statues on the roof make a museum or theatre more functional than it would be without them, It seems like a plain house could serve as well as a beautiful one, While pieces of art cost the government and private companies significant amounts of money; the architectures contunue challenging the world by creating amazing and incredible buildings, Some of them are created just to please the eye of judging public; whereas the others are trying to conquer physics, It turns out that people don't want something functional and ugly, Beauty is one of human needs, No one will deny feeling themselves pleased and admired when walking around some old yet still marvellous pieces of architecture in the city centres; looking at churches and precious monuments; visiting meaningful squares, However; not only old architecture matters, As the time goes by; new forms of art appear and architectures try either to follow the fashion of the decade or to create someting new and unseen, People's desire for beauty is shown also by some public questioning about the issues such as the look of a new underground station, To sum up; I would say that it's not only proper serve the properties of a building that is important to the population, Beauty is another very important feature of achitecture, That's the reason why people still try saving old buildings and produce more fine pieces of art, 	2345	386	350+

First of all; if we speak of equality of men and women we should make a notice that this also mean that women could not do some work which is not suit them (take heavy things), In other ways it is known that females can choose freely their profession, Secondly; we can easily think of jobs which will be more priority for males such as military professions, What is the goal of setting the rule when universities accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject? Will it really provide equality? It is set by the laws that everyone has an opportunity to study the subject he prefers, This rule is enough for the realisation of the principle mentioned above, Another factor which may be set against that rule is a different propostion of population of males and females in the country, It would be hard to reach equal numbers because women simply can be more than men or overwise; so this argument makes that rule almost impossible, Of course universities may try to bistribute males and females during educational process in different groups equaly and that probably will bring positive result, To sum up; everyone both males and females has a right and opportunity to choose their profession and study in a place they want, It will not be appropriate for university workers trying to choose students by the criteria of equality of males and females instead of professional qualities and knowledge; which may have every person,	1854	317	300+

Of boys are interested in mathematics; they will choose it in their unithersities, The situation is the same with girls and humanitarian studies, In my view; universities really have a situation when more males than females want to learn some subjects, This is the reason why some faculties has not equal number of men and women, I think the try have equal-numbered maled and femaled courses is crashing down; because of this fact, Universities just cannot provide this idea among students; where everybody wants to learn something interesting; not equal-numbered, Overwise there are some factors make people think that equal number of males and females is important, The key point is that in faculty; there are; for example; 10 girls and 10 boys; educational process goes better as a result of comparison of views, Scientists also think that this way of studying is good for student's future; because they became more tolerant and peaceful to the other sex compared with social groups where are same sex people; which are more likely to be sexists, To sum up; I can say that having both the equal and non-equal number of males and females could bring some advantages and drawbags for communication, Although I bekieve universities should gain an interest to a subject as a key point of studying,	1807	307	300+

It is a highly significant issue, The first group of people supposes that new sport facilities promote healthy lifestyle and motivate children doing sport, Sports objects is a great tool in the fight against obesity; which causes a lot of deseases, People think that sport helps to build a good immune protection, Anyway the second group thinks that the policy of increasing the number of sports objects is not efficient; and it is wrong to spend on this a lot of money, such people say that some humans have restrictions; that do not allow them to do sport, Also doing sport can cause various injuries; which just make our healthy worse, Personally I suppose that the government should build new sports objects and promote healthy lifestyle, Anyway this policy should not be the only way of increasing the level of public health, We should also spend our money and attention on preventing some types of illnesses by doing special tests and analyses, We should make our environment more cleaner because the dirty air causes a lot of dangerous deseases, Also government should invest money into development of new ways of treatment, To sum up I would like to point out that we should not concentrate only on the one type of policy, The policy of increasing the number of sports objects has some advantages and disadvantages, And we should analise them and create different programms; which can help to solve the negative effect of such way of behaviour,	1919	325	300+

There are different opinions about this case, Some people see the solving of problem in increasing the number of sports facilities, Of course it is impotant step to the relevant way, Because the number of facilities can rise the possibilities of people to do sport, For instance; you can choose the more appropriate facility which responce of your requests and availability, On the other hand; people predicte the little effect of this and require the other measures, In same part they are right, In needs to use more stricte and global actions, For exemple; the propogand of the health style of life on the TV; on Internet and by advertisment, The government must to use the policy which tend attention to the question of nation health; and moreover the international policy must diclarate in whole world that we need to change an world for increase the level of health of all our generation, In my opinion both these points of view is correct and that we need to developping in these distinctions in one time, We need at first; that in minds of people will be the things about their health and that they desire to be more healthy and to learn they children in right way, Because the children are our futur, In conclusion; for get good resalts it is appropriate to use all measures which we see and which we can realise,	1452	259	250+

We try to answer a bit later, On the one hand; increasing the number of sport facilities can help everyone to become healther, But it need some time for this; for example; we need to visit gym twice a week for 2 hour, Some people don't have these time, Furthemore; to become stronger you should have some diet; if you don't; any sport facilities can't help you, On the other hand; without a huge number of sport facilities; you can't find you sport; which you like and which is more usefull for you, So people will not doing sport well and then it will be a result of small effect for them, Another reason of small effect is wrong timetable, Your sports activity should be regulary; and at the one time, If you don't follow your timetable; all you activity will had a bad result, So a big amount of sport facilities will help your to follow timetable and to have a amazing result, To sum the information; we can say that a uncreasing amount of sport facilities help people to fing their sport and do it regular, As a result men's health would be better, It's the easiest way to improve public health without any fantastic outcomes, But people should have time to do sport, It they not have time; of cause; it will be not effect to their health,	1549	289	250+

"Perfomance" - it may be explanation for every action of people, This man is destroying building - it is perfomance! Group of people takes trash bins on their heads and hug you - it is perfomance! True art can be shoking or even dangerous, So I think that there should be a list of restricts, But are there some advantages? I demand yes, There are a lot of types of arts that would make our life brighter and more beautiful if it would be allowed; for example; graffity, Good graffity can decorate old garages; half-destroyed buildings, If you travel by a train or use train to come home from your work you see a lot of graffity during your road and most of them are not ugly or disappointing, So why people who made this must be stopped? For conclusion; I can say that giving absolute freedom for artist is risky and there should be a list of restricts; just to provide other people's safety and confidence, I think that goverment should give more freedom for artist; but not absolute, Artist's perfomances must be controlled, But in general more art in our life can make life better,	1391	248	200+

The competition should; and only strongest ones should be able to study in the university; and it isn't metter is it a man or woman, All in all; I must confess; that it is a quite complicated topic, But; I also think; that this idea is really unfair, In the tryings to destroy the gender boards; to make everybody equal; to make our society absolutely tolerant; people no longer fallow the human sence, In my firm belief; we must stop it before it is too late,	1917	348	300+

On the one hand; long prison sentences literally prevent other crimes, Robber or killer will spent the rest of life in prison and will not do more harm, Moreover; law brakers afraid of prison and will not commit into crime to avoid it, On the other hand; prison deteriorate and brakes people's mind and lifes, After prison people cannot find jobs; friends and change their lifestyhle on the whole, There is a big possibility that after some time person after prison will do ahother crime, This consequence is unavoidable; because people use to see and to do harm or pain, As for me; I find long prison sentences too cruel and harmful for people, There are so many stories about people who were innocent and due to the mistake were sent to prison and lost everything, Community should create another way of improving, It could be different jobs or social help, In any case; people have to help each other and first of all government should understand; why person did the crime, I understood it after reading Leo Tolstoy's novel "Voskresenie"; where the main character tries to understand the rules of life in prison and the reasons of beeing there, Tolstoy gives a clear idea that everybody can change the life of prisoner and prevent a crime; people should save their kindness and morality and help each other,	1608	281	250+

All these people will use buses; trains; cars for travelling; so the atmosphere will polluted with dust more than even now, Secondly; if businessmen and ordinary people will not get an access to air plains; unternational unions are going to be destroyed; because will be no opportunity to communicate with other communicate with other countries as well as before, Furthermore; ordinary people and families will not have an opportunity to visit foreign countries; to develop their minds and broaden their look, Thirdly; not only planes contribute to global warming and pollution, Factory and plant furms; people's wastes are more harmful for our planet; that only planes, So it is extremely important to take some measures to cut the quantity of another sources for atmosphere's pollution, To crown it all; it can be said; that society must ensure steps are taken to prevent the environmental problem from deteriorating futher; and the reducing of air travel is not the suitable way to tackle this problem,	1859	307	300+

I think it is subjective to a certain extent, Second reason which I am not for reducing the number of flights by is that; on my opinion; there is not alternative kind of transport, Air ships are convinient because of their speed; comfortability and ability to shift on long distances, Thus; I believe that such measures as banning of a part of flights is not the optimal measure; because it seems to me that there are other ways of pollution which are more detrimental; and in order to save the environment; one should begin with them,	1173	203	200+

But producers gave a lot of arguments that the main reasons of global warming are gases from factories; too much cars using by people and the global changes in world's climate, Overall; I can say that the author's opinion is not correct for 100%, Of coure using airplanes can cause som bad effect on the ecology of the Earth; but there are reasons that are much more important; and governments should pay more attention for them,	1693	302	300+

Personally I strongly disagree with the view above, To begin with; nowadays it is a lot of other transport systems; such as cars; buses; ships; etc; so why it is thinked that only air travelling polluted the atmosphere? Furthermore; reducing the air travelling is impossible in modern society; because it will stop the life of million people who use air transport every day, But there are people who declare the fact; that many of earth transport become more and more clear from day to day, They believe; that new cars will be non-dangerouse for our planet and we should refuse air travelling at all, The opinion above sounds good; but science is not create such beautiful safety transport yet; so in my opinion no matter what transport is using by people; it is polluting air in any ways, In addition; once a life I was changed my air travel for travel by car; and it was uncomfortable and taken really much time, To make a conclusion; I would like to say that air pollution and global warming is extremely important problem that must have a solution, But reducing the amount of air travel is not wisdom decision until it will be created and provided a suitable exchange for this type of transport,	1453	257	250+

Further more; there ice melting in the eydges of out world because of global warming and the level of waters in the oceans is slightly rising, It is obviously dangerous for coastlines and even a big cities can be in dangerous situation, Moreover; it touches all the humanity that there will be a bad concentration of toxins in the air so it may provide toxic rains especially in industrial cities, Many people think that there have been much unnecessary flights and the air travel for leisuring are unnecessary too, They suggest to introduce the laws to regulate those flights, So this position aims the long-time perspective of prevention of bad affects burnt fuel cause, In the other point of view; planes were invented to allow people travel fast and comfortable wherever they want, As we introduce those laws to stop air travelling we interrupt people's free to movement, People will suffer of this feeling and maybe cannot plan their holidays normally, There will be some injustice caused for groups of people, Also; business pand economic processs will not go at their normal way so there is bad effect on economical system, In conclusion; though it is hard to access but I think those laws should be introduced to stop this big affect on nature and humanity, It is more important to save our planet,	1958	346	300+

Firstly; we should understand the reasons of this problem, As far as I know; children without school education tend to commit crimes, Because they have a lot of free time without doing anything; they have no social skills which are provided by school and they are used to reach their goals by violence and crime, Another important reason of it is that parents didn't pay enough attention to their children, For example; they are spending all time at work, So; children become too independent from parents and they can easily find a bad behaviour role mode, I mean that they can watch TV and think that villians or killers are good and cool persons, But it is not the most tragic reason of it, When your parents are cruel and violent persons with alhogol or drug addiction; it is really difficult to become a good man because your are living in the world full of dark and murky people, That is why young people comitt crimes, They have never seen the normal life or another way to realise yourself, There are only few reasons of this problem below, But I think that it is enough to launch discussion about it, So; what should parents and teachers do to find the solution of this problem? Firstly; parents should pay more attention to their children, Of course; someone says that it is easily only when you talking about it, Yes; it is obvious but parents are the most important people for their children, So; you should stop drinking a lot; spend holidays with your son or dauther and try to be a good example for him, Schools make equal level of infuance on our children, So; teachers should make more affords to do education process more interesting and useful for young people, They should convince students that education is the greatest way in their life to realise yourself without evil, Because education is not only about math or physics; it is also about our life; tolerance and kindness, In conclusion; I think that this problem is wide spread in our world, And we have no rights to neglect it anymore, Because it means that we are not thinking about our future, But it is not true, So; love your childrents and study harder!	2428	435	350+

In essence; the public just take their money, If such a tendency continues; then people limit their investments; there will appear a lack of financial resources and the quality of products will dramatically drop, This means illegal buyers damage economic and cultural spheres in general, By the way; nowadays governments tend to start punishing breaking the law online actions, It relates to posts and cites in social networks, Breaking rights of the investors is also a crime, So if the government punishes one illegal actions why doesn't it do the same to the other, That is ease of unjustice, All in all; internet users who buy pirate products break the rights of the official dealers and steal their money, It is probable to be a drop of the media industry, So the goverment should follow the justice and support the producers,	1482	244	200+

Let us think about it, Many people think the best way to increase crime is to give longer prison sentences, From my point of view; it is not a great idea, If person have courage to do some wrong ations he\she do it, Poople who think about crime know that they will be punishment, And for them there is no difference how mach time they will spend in the prison, I strongly believe; that the only fear of the death can reduce the crime, All people afraid of it, If The person knows that punishment for his actions is death; he will do everything to avoid it, Moreover; there will no possibility to leave a prison earlier, It will be a magnificent "lesson" for everyone who do not think about rights of other peopel and laws, Of course; a lot of people СЃan say that it is so cruel and we have no rights to kill people even if he or she is a killer who brought a great amount of lives, Besides; this moral scheme does not work in the real life, It is ugly; but people are animals that think only about thamselves, To sum up; for me it is obviously that the best way to decline crime is the fear of the death, Live is the most important thing for all of us and each person do everything to save it,	1537	296	250+

My posotion is the same for working buildings, Actually; I would be happy if there were a kind of stylish difference between living areas and working spaces, For instance; there is Moscow city in Moscow, If you look around there; you will feel kind of working spirit, Probably you will want to wear up a skirt and a blouse; glasses or will easily imagine yourself sitting in a co-working zone fast typing something imporant in your laptop with a cup of coffee, To summurise; I realise; this is a utophia; but one guy said; that you have to dream whatever you can, That why I totally disagree about making just purposal-clear buildings, The way it looks like also shows what it is for, 	2110	377	350+

To the esthetic part or to the reliability and comfort? I think it depends on the situation and now I will try to explain why, To begin with; We all understand beauty in our own unique way, So we cannot want from the architects to build something satisfying for our taste, But we can expect them to build something that will not fell apart, We have to be sure that we can calmly sleep in nights in our house or do not worry about our safety when we visit some public places, Every architect should have priorities and safety of people should come first, What the point to build a masterpiece when it will not survive long time? When we want to go to the mall we want it to be comfortable; we do not care much about its beauty, Same about parking places or airports, But would be our world even half that beautiful if all architects would worry only about buildings serve their purpose and not about beauty? In this case of course our world would lose a lot, All famous capitals and historical places would not be even famous anymore, Traveling itself would stop make any sense, We love Greece or Italy because we can enjoy the work of great architects from the past, And we love to visit casual places as malls or cafes when we travel because they are different from what we used to see in our countries, We can see how architect planed building not just comfortable and safe; but also esthetically stunning, Due to that each street has its own face, Tourists or citizens can enjoy this art beauty even when they just took a walk without going to the museum or gallery, To conclude; I would like to say that all building has to serve their own purpose; however; sometimes this purpose is to make people happy and leave them memorizable moments about certain place, 	2035	373	350+

It is an average thought that buildings should be made only to perfectly serve their purposes, I cannot agree with it but at the same time I will not say that aesthethics is the first and the last thing which architects should worry about, The truth is in the middle, If we go throughout the Russian history; we'll find a period in 60s when people and the country needed the cheap and effective places to live - so Soviet architects created whole districts of the same buildings later be known as 'khruschovki', They are ugly; they don't catch an eye of man; but they perfectly matched their purpose - to give flats to Soviet residents, Now the strategy of the builders use can be called 'higher!', New districts full of the 20; 30; 40-staged buildings which can place as much people as it can be possible, For me; this situation is also a tragedy for our sense of beauty, It can be understood that such houses are for daily life - but who will really enjoy living there; everyday watching windows of opposite houses? Skyscrappers are beautiful when they are _skyscrappers_ - when they have style and there are a lot of them in the area; like in Mainhatten, Even bright colours and graffities will not rescue buildings I described, In Europe; for example in Finland; the houses are mostly small and minimalistically stylish, They do not have complex architectural decisions and are absolutely modern; but do not lose warm atmosphere and easilky awaken a wish to live there, For me; it is the best situation of the compromiss between beauty and purpose, To sum up; I can say that architects should be able to find a balance between beautiful; but senseless building and grey; even effective 'khruschovka', 	2064	351	350+

It is obvious that some faculties are more attractive to male part of mankind; and some of subjects to female part, If we want to accept equal numbers of male and female students; we will be obliged to force some humans enter in the wrong way, It will not be surprise that everyone want to make their choice personally; esperiully in question of education, In different point of view situation in sex balance between males and femals in universities will start tendency on granting really equal rights for everyone, Differences between man and woman in social ladder will become a legend; except physical development, We will see a society of women-poliyics; women-militaries and men-homekeepers, Who needs that? I do not know, To summarize it is sufficient to say that physical differences will play their role forever, There will be fair fight between male and female minds; but mankind know so many male names; and so little number of female important persons in science and politics, We can't fight with the nature; but we can change our own rules,	1767	296	250+

University should not tell "You must study here because you are a male or female"; they should give us chance to make a choice; choose a right direction and make a decision, If universities give equal access to different direction for women and men they can choose so we get modern society with develop professions where every person do work which can be done by their individual skills, To sum up; the general idea of modern education is not equal amount of girls and boys but is iqual access to this education!	1506	251	250+

As for me; the main thing is that people are born with potencial; but they are not equal it is like cars; some of them have more horse power then others and that's why you can do nothing with it, People study and work hard; but not all of then will win Nobel prize or become a bolionere and that's because of potencial, We can make our little theoretical experiment; let's take two random people a put them in same conditions from their burth to death and we will see that they won't reach same result; one will be better that another (of course you have got % that they will be equal! but it is unlikely or just too small %), This characteristic is just like IQ; some people are clever than other; this is characteristic you are born with and you can do anything with it; you can strnyle with it or just deny it; but you have your limit and that's all, To sum up; I want to say that in all ways your must study and work hard; because even if you are talented or not you must work hard to reach your great goals,	1364	261	250+

If we look on the one side of this problem; we will say actually "Yes!", All people must have the same rules, But other's belief is that not all girls can studie economic disciplins; math or phisics, One the one hand this is a problem; but is it really? So; let's have a look, For example; in the end of June in owe(?) country all youngh people; who finised education at school; give there documents to the universities, Almost girls choose literature; social sciences and so on and boys choose phisical faculties, Is it a problem of the university; that there a lot of male students in this subject and a lot of female student in the another, I am not sure that this is a problem of the university, On my faculty on cultural studies in the Higher School of economics there are a very little number of male students, But if the facultie take the same number of students both genders there would be only 6 men on the first course last year, But if we believe scientists; all people are the same; and there are no problem of gender in our life; but in real life we see the other picture, As for me there are no problem that there are less boys on my facultie, If I want to communicate with men; I must do it after my studie and the gender problem must'n be interesting to me when I learn new words or read a text about philosophy of Kant, When you are in the university all students both genders must have the same gender, And it isn't a question of libertie of female rates; this is a problem of level of education,	1850	351	350+

In my opinion it is important that the universities provide both male and female students with an equal access to the exams and faculty places, It is clear that nowadays women have become more confident and are not afraid to participate in the competitions with their male counterparts, Right after the 19th century feminist movement women acquired many rights firstly reserved specifically for men; including the right to study, If a woman can study in the chosen field she can make a good career for herself applying her knowledge appropriately, Also the division of subjects on "male" and "female" ones is quite ridiculous as it doesn't consider the talents of each given individual, If a man wants to be a poet or a designer or a teacher it doesn't that he will grow to be less masculine in the same fashion as the woman who chooses to study engineering or mathematics doesn't lose her femininity, Everyone should be able to follow their dream and the faculty choice is the first step towards its relation, On the whole I argue that all the universities should decide weather to allow or not each given student to study in the certain subject judging not by their gender but by their knowledge and eagerness,	1575	274	250+

It is a very appropriate problem; and there are several points to think about, Firstly; of cause; in twenty-first century; when democracy is the spread in most of countries and human rights are standed(?) non-gender;it is necessary to lead the rules of democracy; and let equal chances to education for students of both genders, Moreover; with last one handreed years women proofed that thaey can work anywhere; not only as nurses or teachers but also as policeman; taxidriver; or even builder, It means that "weak gender" is not so weak; and it has rights to get any profession, Futhermore; nowadays there is a lack of professional personal in particular spheres of production such as engineering; chemistry; physics, And it is irrelivant not to give chance for people who want to wark just becaus they are woman, On the other hand; even equal amount of studt places for every subject for man and woman can lead to disturbing atmosphere in classes, Both of students will be paying attention to each other; not to course; which is bad, Although; of cause anybody could do any job; but despite this fact there are proffesions which are more suitable for one of the gendres, It is impossible to ignore this fact, So; getting equal number of man and woman to every faculty may mean that talanted man or woman can have no study place and may be forced to choose another profession which is not suitable for him or her, All in all; it is obvious that it should not be any gender segregation in education process, But there are some rules which is necessary to use while organising this process for both genders students,	1747	303	300+

To my point of view; I cannot really realise how such system could work in real situation, It would change all educational system at all!

To my mind; increasing number of sports facilities will not change the situation in modern society; because nowadays very often people have to tire not only to do sports; but even to sleep enough or cook dinner, That is why new sports buildings will not lend the increasing number of their "club members", What is more; same health problems cannot be solved by new sports areas, For instance; cancer or blood diseases, However; the most widespread areas modern people are illness of cardio system and; of course; overweight, In this case doing some sport is the best way to improve public health, Moreover; new playgrounds are important in poor regions to decrease the level of crimes; because little potential burglars "will spend their free time playing football instead of meeting each other in dark places", But; surely; I do think that improving sports facilities is not enough to provide people's health, The most important is to explain them that their health depends on their own choice : to eat or not to eat junk food; to have a walk or to sit in front of the screen; watching TV; to do everything to be healthy or to do nothing, And if people understand that the problem of their health is inside of them; public health will; consiquently; be improved, In conclusion; the best way to change the situation in population's health is not only to invest in new sports buildings; but to explain people how important it is to keep fit and to stay healthy and how their behavior in present will influence on their health in future; This way; I guess; it the most sensible and the most helpful,	1805	317	300+

What kind of measures are required for this goal? Some people suggest to increase the number of sport facilities, I don't sure that it will be have great utility, Nowadays there are a lot of fitness and sport centres; but the quantity of people; whose attempt them not to high as thought, It can be cause of high price for aboniment in this centres, That is why increasing the number of facilities is not best deccion, One of the ways to solve this problem is to give people more opportunities for good rest, For example; to make prices on different sports centres lower and people could be able to allow themselves this kind of rest, Besides; emploeers can motivate people to be more carefull and keep fit by different perks, Organisations can make various competition which will help relax and to do the best for team sprint, However; to be health is the decision of each other, Nobody not can make you to cae about your health if you do not want it, Government can only care about quality of products and foods and provides as opportunities to keep our health, All things considered; I strongly believe that every person should think about their health byself, If there are not enough sport facilities; person who want to be health; finals another ways for this goal, That is way; I'm sure that increasing the number of sports facilities is not solution of this problem,	1549	273	250+

I suppose that the main problem with happiness is that nobody knows what he or she really wants, I don't remember how to say it correctly; but one author said "The happiness is not to lose the possibility to wait your happiness", In my opinion it's more important to have the possibility than just thinking about what happiness exactly is, There is one truth about happiness at all - nobody knows what it is and everybody find it in very different ways, No one can tell you how to be happy besides you, In conclusion I want to say that if you know what happiness is - it isn't real happiness, No one knows how you can be happy even if they are happy themselves, It's your own way - how to be happy and I can't say what factors are important to to be happy because I'm not you and you aren't me,	1498	289	250+

On the other hand this decision will break this social intolerance idea in one of the most important aspects of our lives such as work in the neasest future, But after all it is not that easy to find same number of different gender on one subject, People are individual and there hopes and future plans can't be predicted, So university that take equal number of students will not have enought students to keep exist, In my opinion; I totaly dis agree with this extent; humanity shouldn't forget about human individuality and creare such extra-tolerance ideas which can easily block our future and high education possebilities, I believe that in our modern society we have good opportunities and nothing is need to be changed,	1746	296	250+

Besides; the working productivity will suffer as well, To conclude; I would like to underline the fact that the offered idea of equal number of male and female students accepted to a university is not only ineffective; but also poses a problem of discrimination,	1862	314	300+

I believe it can't and there are several reasons for such opinion, First of all; all people cannot have the same skills, It is widely known that the majority of boys has better and dipper skills in Mathematics than girls, So; it is obvious that universities cannot accept the equal number of boys and girls in some technical subjects, Also; not many boys are interested in Arts; Literature or Design; that is why it is impossible to have equal proportion of people of both genders in these subjects, Secondly; women are not able to study some subjects as it is dangerous or too difficult for them, For example; universities cannot accept girls to study some specific kinds of surgery as very hard equipment is used there, What is more; some military universities do not accept women because men and women have different mental and psychological skills, It can be really hard or even impossible for young women to fight against other people with weapons, On the other hand; it could be said that in the 21st century there should not be differentiation between genders and universities should accept equal proportion of boys and girls for each subject, Modern young women are strong and smart enough to enter a military or technical university, All in all; I strongly believe that it is not possible to have 50:50 proportion of men and women in all kinds of universities, The most important thing for universities to have students that have appropriate skills in a subject and are interested in it whichever gender these students are,	1726	294	250+

Secondly; when travelling people may easily lose good terms with some friends as well as miss the situations happening in their families, Choosing working instead of travelling the free year is the last chance; probably; to relax before hard studying, It is extremely important to get ready for university studies in a unwind atmosphere, Anyway; it is much better rather than spending all the time on working, In conclusion; I would like to notice that everyone chooses the way of life he will be then satisfied with, Surely all the pros and cons should weighed up and taken into attention when making the right decision,	1878	312	300+

Taking everything into consideration; it is worth saying that the plan to make equal the number of male and female students in all subjects is neither effective nor cheap, The government will be forced to pay for students who have nor motivation neigher ability (including physical) to do their best on the future working place, Moreover; these measures are not legitimate and lawful; as they violate the basic right of the person to realize his/her knowledge or talent on the place that he/her have already chosen for future education or work,	3099	532	350+

A variety of different researches had given some results; and now specialists explain the reasons of bad behaviour in next ways (which; I agree with): for example; they say; hooligans are victims of their personal problems - being heartbroken; experiencing the parents' divorce, Physchologists note that young girls and boys (especially; teenagers) go through such problems with difficulties - they give full or anger; hatred; sorrow and etc, speaking about example for this; we can remember the frontman of rock-group "Nirvana" who became angry at the people around; cynic after his mother and father had broken up, Another reason which is noted by specialists is a wish to seem better; stronger for somebody (boys fight; girls look at the winner), If you want an example; we can remember the film "Back to Future" - Marty Mcfly's father was threeted by his classmate; Biff Tannen; who wanted to be the strangest boy for girls around him and his company, How to solve this problem? In my opinion; mothers and fathers should speak with their children and try to help them instead of ignoring, They are ought to anticipate the risk of turning into hooligan and don't let kids solve any difficulties with fists; kicks; weapons; murders, And for kidsвЂ¦ They must believe to their nearest and dearest,	1706	281	250+

On the one hand; this idea has many advantages, First one is low-costed employ of local workers, For example; "Apple" company build their own main factories in China there they spend less money on creating of Iphones; Ipads and etc, If you have Iphone or Ipad; just check there it was produced, Secondly; taxes in poor and developing countries are very low, That helps companies to have financial benefits out of this, For example; "Volvo" builds their cars in Novosibirsk; Russia, That helps them avoid taxes of Russian Federation then they import their product, They only pay taxes for car production which are very low in Russia, On the other hand; the process of changing location to poorer and developing countries is very expensive, For example; "Apple" company spent billions of dollars on building their factories in China, Yes; they found their own benefits there by low-costed workers; but before that they spent huge amount of money on re-organization of their company in different country, Secondly; there is a very demanding law process, Before you can open your company in the other country you have to get many documents, Many companies cannot afford themselves buying; for example; license for producing and selling their product, In my opinion; idea to move buisnesses to slow developing countries is very good; but not every company can afford it, The process of changing the location is very demanding financially and emotionally, For example; "Apple" company or "Volvo" company can afford themselves to do their buisnesses in other countries, But; for example; our Russian company called "Lada-cars" which is actually a very big company; unfortunately; cannot afford to do buisness in other countries, Only to export their product,	2111	342	300+

Firstly; organizing business in developing countries is much cheaper than in developed ones, For example; employment of working staff costs less money for business in developing countries and often employer doesn't have to provide employees with any bonuses and perks as poor countries have poor salaries and no undertading of medical and social assuarence that company usually provides in developed countries, And also business in other country helps to escape some taxes in your own country that may be a burden for businessmen, Secondly; such business provides great amount of working places for poor people and increases their level of wellness, Often these companies help to organize the structure of the place; where it's situated in general, However; this kind of business may not be profitable as the supplyment and export should be organized and this costs may be harmful for business, Also international giants may become a divide for developing of local businesses that are very important for developing countries, But local companies aren't able to compete with international ones as local businssmen lack the experience and fiances in comparison to their competitors, In conclusion I'd like to say that there should be balance between local and international businesses and international companies shouldn't be a divide for development of the country in general, However I find this tendency of moving business mostly positive as for those who have business and for developing areas where it's placed,	1767	276	250+

And what are the disadvantages? First of all; I'd like to emphasise the fact that more and more foreingers from developing countries try to move to Europe in order to be payed and treated better than in their own countries, This fact shows that there are still a vast amount of people working under the same conditions that the others who have already moved anywhere used to work, This means that big companies are surely aware of the fact too; so in order to make the production much more cheaper they move their headquarters to the poorer countries, Also developing countries boast of their people's stamina and hard-work so it is quite tempting to get a great workers and lessen the expenses, Secondly; mastering new territories give a great opportunities to develop not only existing industries but creating the new ones, Developing countries are full of fossils and natural resources which haven't been touched by humans before ;so the nature and the good old technology of the developed countries may combine for the better results, Thirdly these areas exclude rivalry between big companies so they can work freely- there are much less big companies in there, Thirdly; the legislations are quite different so in some countries it is much more easily to do something which is strictly forbidden in any other and the majority of workers are surely not aware of their rights so it is easier for companies to manipulate due to poor education level, Anyway I am mot a professional in the field but watching so many documentaries on the net I must confess that sometimes I see big companies as a monstrous machines enslaving people in developing countries, It is heart-breakingly sad seeing them coping with famine and surviving as the companies are vasting and thriving on them all the time, Unfortunately; I do not comprehend the laws of business and stuff so I am just be satisfied with the fact that companies give people more workplaces becuase unemployment is the great problem of the whole world; not talking about the developing countries,	2456	413	350+

Are there more positive or rather negative effects in all that? Discussing these controversial it is impossible to give one well-defined answer for sure, On the one hand; it is obvious that airplanes have bad influence for environmental, We need a clean air every day for live; and without access to clear air we will die, Probably nobody would argue that it is an disadvange, On the other hand this attitude may cause a lot of concerns among people who believe that air travel give the ability for comfortable and fast change location in the world, In conclusion; I want to say that it is impossible to estimate all the benefits and drowbacks of air pollutions and air travel,	878	155	150+

Some of advantages of such kind of decisions seems really attractive, For example; such measures will bring some economical profits for the company; such as low cost of labor force; low tax rate and planty of people who are willing to work for any sum of money, Moreover; the "host country" benefits too, The government collect more taxes, People have waraing places, Almost; one of the advantages of such decision is including of country in modern global economicy; giving impulce to the globalisation, On the other hand the "mother country" of such company have less in taxes, Moreover; it almost last a huge amount of working places elevating the problem of unemployment, Modern socials are struggeling with the problems and replacing of industy just makes the thing worse, And; finally; country still have some problems in addition to benefits; for example the low rate of human rights and low level of life, And still; this country becomes dependent on foreign capital; wich can become an obstacle for development of local industry, As we can see disadvantages outweight the advantages; and it becomes obvious in the contect of soviety benefits, Modern countries try to return industry from the outside because they lost a lot of profit, And I am totally agree with such position; as I think that the country can't be convically strong without industry, In conclusion I would like to add; that; of course; companies gain a lot from moving their business to same not-so-rich countries; but their own society have just tosses,	1749	290	250+

Let's consider, Let's start with the point of view; that the governments should ignore this situation and the amount of flights remains steady, There are a lot of advantages, Firstly; people can travel by plane as often as they want, Secondly; the price for tickets stays the same, As for disadvantages; the global warming and air pollution because of the air transport hurmes our planet, Now let's consider the opinion; that the governments should reduce the amount of flights, This situation has its advantages: air transport will pollute the atmosphere less; and there will be less air accidents, But this situation has a lot of disadvantages, Firstly; the price for tickets to planes will rise quickly, Only rich people will fly, Secondly; the majority of population will use other kinds of pub transport; for example; trains; cars; ships, So; we can't say; that these types of transport hurms our environment less; than planes, Thirdly; the tourism will stop to develop; because of lack of planes, Te fact; that the majority of people prefer to travel abroad for many thousands km, In addition si the same problems will take place in business, To sum it up; it is no need for governments to decline the amount of air travel; because firstly; air transport is the safest transport; secondly; without air transport our world stops develop,	1826	309	300+

Firstly; usually both parents should go out for working because of financial problems, It is very hard to grow up children and have family because all goods; education; medicine have high costs, Secondly; women nowadays are trying to become independent; work as men and realise yourselves in life, Communication with parents and spending time with them are the essential part of progressive growing up for child, The lack of them can have influence on their future life, Parents should pay attention on their child; love; give knowledge and take care, Otherwise; child will feel yourself uncomfortable; not needed and unhappy, These feelings can destroy his dreams and believe in yourself, Moreover; children can have negative information from harmful people and nobody cannot help, On the other hand; children; who have lack of socializing with parents; can grow up in strong; responsible adults, They solve our problems themselves; do not afraid of real life, It is important to know measure of spending time with children, In conclusion; the issue of parents and children is very notiable for both sides, Parents should not forget about family life; they have influence on their children' person,	1595	254	250+

First of all; the step of determination have to be mentioned, It is widely known that child always pure, And if the problem exists in the family; it is parents guilt, No matter when the issue happened; parents someday made a mistake in their relation to child, So; the most effective way to solve the problem is to spent more time with their childrens, It is simple way on the first glass; but it is absolutely not easy to do, People should what is more valuate for them - their little creation or work, They have to remember that child has its own world and if parents will be outside this area; something really bad happens, Work and career is not a real being; it can't think and feel emotions; it doesn't need someones love as childrens do, All the problems are solvable here, The second way; is suitable mostly for teenagers and grown-ups, They sometimes can be really angry and cold to their parents, After many years of silence and dealing with the issue their attention became much more bad, It is important to break the ice; forget and let go old situations, Clear view on their parents; understanding of their world; full of career; their own problems and meaning actions can solve problem in a neutral way, After this neutral level both parents and childrens have to go to a positive level, Remember some funny situations; they experienced together; or discuss some interesting for them themes, Taking everything into account; I therefore conclude that attention and care are two ways to sucess and solve this important problem,	1918	340	300+

There are many different answers, The most popular is to give longer prison sentences, It is effective in sence that criminals are in prison and therefore have no opportunity to do something bad, Someone who whants to do crime will afraid, But many people thinks that this is way is not so humanic and effective for the following reasons, At first supporting prisons is very expensive, But this is not main reason, If someone stole the car at 16 and then we give him 20 years of prison then when he live it he will be aggressive and more criminal because did not get education and so on, And he lived 20 years in criminal atmosphere, For example my father stole the boat when he was 20 years old, Judge gave him 10 yers of prison and when he lived in prison he stole another boat, In my opinion we should find other solutions for this problem, For example we can develop special programs of rehabilitation for ex-criminals or improve general quality of life; then there will be less reasons to do crime,	1043	190	150+

On the other hand we can't deny from planes now, Because today it's a faster way for travelling, In business every hour is important, Time is money, And our life is too short, We can't lose many time in way, At the end I want to say again that government is right on this situation and it's a really good that they thinking about ecology and future of our planet, We must love our planet and we mustn't destroy it, Our children will grow up here, I think we live in era when we began care about whole situation!

These number of people believe that it could lead to a "death" of cinema as a way of spending your freetime and meeting with your friends; because you can stay at home and watch a moovie, The critics of punishment speak about the disability of comparison the crime like steeling something and pirate copying: the rate is the same, Moreover; it is very hard to bring some evidence and find a criminal; so it will only lead to overdealing among policemen, Well; to point out my own position I can say that nowadays the industry of cinema and music is transitioned into the internet area it is really convenient to stay at home and listen to music; for instance, All in all; despite this fact pirats break the rules and need to pay some money for it; but not be taken into prison, In conclusion; we need to claim that government should think about the ways of making it easier for people to post music and films in the internet; as this industry is developing everydays, Legal ways sometimes are too costly; that is why all done illegaly, No matter if these changes will be done or not; there are differnt points of view on this issue,	1633	294	250+

On the one hand; we all understand that in modern world making music and films often is all about money, Authors spend a lot of recources for studios; actors; marketing and so on; and they have a right to get their investment back with some kind of payment from society, And in this model; internet is a factor which blocks a huge amount of sales because some part of films and music auditory prefers to get this content for free and forgets about payment to creators, While this happens; authors get less money than they could; so there is less motivation for them to create new interesting content, In this way of thinking it looks like we should say "yes; we need to punish pirates", But from the other side; we should understand that the process of customer's decision making is pretty difficult, People don't want to spend money for thing they are low informed about; but when we; for example; get possibility to listen some musician for free; it's easier for us to make decision about buyin tickets at his concert, So; free content may be a part of business, As for me; we can do nothing with fact that internet changes markets; so content creators should learn how to change their models of monetisation and make them more suitable to the modern world, So if people don't want to pay for music; we should check; for example; if they are ready to pay for ways to listen it with comfort (like Apple music for iPhone), Creators need to do their suggestion to customers more complexe, Or die,	1969	354	350+

And what are we to do to decrease the number of crimes committed by the young? In my opinion; there is a number of reasons for new generation to be more into illegal behaviour, First of all; they are much more childish and infantile; than previous generations, From my experience I can say that a lot of people of my age are irresponsible and still can't live on their own, Surprisingly; their parents do nothing in order to change it and don't try to help their children to become truly adult, Therefore; since the young don't feel themselves responsible for their doings they commit more crimes and don't think about the future, It is also important to say that modern culture literally propogate violence and crimes, Such propaganda works better on the young people and makes them think of criminal actions as of something worth doing, Now we need to enderstand what to do to diminish the crime among the younger generation, I think that the main way to do this is to teach youngsters to be more responsible, Parents and teachers need to educate them on what is the punishment for the illegal behaviour and make them understand that their life is only in their hands and in nobody's else, As for Russia; I think that young people in my country should start working more early and move out from parents as soon as possible, It worked well for me and I am sure it will work well for others, However; I also think that the main problem is not the lack of responsible or violence on TV and Internet; it may be just different view on the world, Every generation is unique and it may be that the laws of the old generation just don't suit the philosophy of the new one, To conclude; I want to say that increased crime rute among youngsters is; indeed; a serious problem, They are our future and if we don't want to live in chaos and anarchy we have to understand how to make the young to obey the law and be useful members of society,	2226	410	350+

So; I am partly agree with the opinion that users which download illegal content must be punished, I suppose they have a right to try the product before buying it, But if they found the content pleasant and want to continue using it - they must "say thanks" to the autors,	1506	284	250+

First of all; some people think that it is wrong to copy because individuals who fond of music or making films spent a lot of money on this thing, Such kind of people spents its free time to produce music or make a film, People just want to receive their fee, What is more interesting; when a person likes copying and sharing music or another object of art; he teaches his children to do it in the same way, Such children are convinced that it is normal, Never the less; other people have claimed that it is profitable and convinient to share and copy music or films, They think that it is very expansive for common people buying the original discs, Besides; very often artists; animators and musicians have charged high prices for their works, Usually; common people cannot allow to themselves to have such expansive original films or musical discs, That is why they just copy it, Such people do not think that it is a crime or that they should be punished, To sum up; I would like to say that illegal pirate copies it is not the best way of enjoying good music or films, In my opinion; copying and sharing art materials should be punished,	1342	243	200+

It seems quite unfair in the centure of democracy, Nevertheless; it is worth remembering about the initial role of music and art of creating films in lives of people, Factually; masters work not for money; but for transferring their feelings; emotions; ideas to hearts; minds and soules of spectaculars and listeners, Naturally; music; films and other gonres of art were allowed for everyone who wished it, It was a common pleasure independent on the size of the wallet, In today's world this law is unlikely to be followed; and it is rather upset, Taking everything into consideration; it can be concluded that the best way to address this issue of pirates copies is to find golden middle between punishments and common wishes to love music and films,	1618	278	250+

The Fans do not have to be punished for their crazy love, To conclude; punishment for the downloading is not effective, People always find alternative way to avoid payment, So; creators should make their creativity available for fans in the World Wide Web,	1504	264	250+

Producers must meet me halfway on the internet; creating convenient and useful on-line resources with their production; and I will buy subscription with a great pleasure; as I am tired of spending hours in search for a video with a proper sound and quality to download from torrents before watching any film, To sum up I would say that I do not think that sharing and copying intellectual properties on the Internet is a crime or any kind of offence; neigher I think it should be controlled by the governmental structures, As any relations concerning purchasing same product this case must be regulated by supply - demand law, I'm sure that seeing the problem in proper way will help consumers to get what they want; producers - to earn their money and goventment - to not waist time and resources on irrelevant things,	1777	310	300+

Once John Lennon said that music should be for each and every one, I strongly agree with him and add that any kind of art should be available for masses and I have a couple of thoughts to support my point of view, First of all; I tend to think that rising the intelligence level of masses or remaining it on the high level is of great importance, If we block ourselves from almost the whole art sphere; we will probably return to the Medievals when human thought and art was in deep crisis, The new Dark ages in XXI century is nonsense so calling the interest in music or film products a crime is not the right thing to do, Secondly; I consider that musicians and producers have much more ways to earn money than just by selling films and records, For instance; musicians go on tour and give concerts and filmmakers have an income while their works are shown in cinematheatres, Taking everything mentioned above into consideration; I believe that by blocking free access to art works people of these industries block themselves from all the money they could earn, Because who would pay money for the unknown and who would go to a music performance if very few people know whose the performance is?	1561	279	250+

In my opinion; all the problems begin in the childhood, Nowadays children watch TV a lot, And there is not a strong censorship; so large amount of films contain the scenes of violence, The same situation is with computer games, Children spend most of their time in front of the computers playing computer games; in many cases because they do not have another ways to entertain themselves, And practically every game is about war; fights or just also containes a lot of violent scenes, All these things can influence a child; make him repeat the actions he notices, Well; the first solution to this problem is to improve the censorship; so to only good and useful films and computer games be available for children, It can help to make them see good actions and repeat them in their lives or to improve their logic, However; modern children and teenagers can easily break the rules and find some ways to get rid of them, What is more; it it significant to do many activities which children from their birth; do not leave their alone on their own, Then they will not be able to waste time in front of the computers and TV, This solution will also be helpful in attempts to make a child be interested in different spheres of life, But; of course; sometimes parents cannot find enough time for their children, And also; an essential solution to this problem is to help a child to find his hobby, It will let him be surrounded with his favourite things; avoid bad influence; not waste their time for some unnecessary things, To sum up; I strongly believe that the number of crimes committed by young people can be reduced; their parents just have to pay attention to their children since they are born,	1960	351	350+

Well; I personally believe that the space expeditions and researches are not standing in the way of solving everyday problems of the society, It is common knowledge that governments of such states that have space programs often do a lot of expences on building spacecrafts and supporting space researching scientists, But these countries usually have a budget that can offord both space industry and spending money on helping to solve such problems like the environmental polutions or coalas extinction, Moreover; the important thing is that not only states' governments do space explorations, There are individual companies that are specialised on evolving what people know about the outer space, One of these companies is SpaceX developed by Elon Mask, This company have done dosens of experiments on landing a space rocket and has plans to make Mars a place where people can live, This fact proves that people can do the science without the help of the state; which saves governments money to deal with other urgent problems, All in all; most people believe that it is useful to learn about how universe works or just explore new worlds; but all of these things can give humanity a chance to find other races or resources that cannot be found on Earth, The science is the engine that makes people develop and this engine should never be stopped,	1568	262	250+

There are two points of view on the last question; and we will try to discuss them both in the actual essay, At the one hand; there is an opinion that we need to give the criminals longer time to spend in the prison, This idea could be suitable; because the prison changes people very much, The lack of freedom; bad conditions and a lot of time to think about their behaviour, Most of murders stop to do steal or kill after they were in the prison, At the same time; this idea is not absolutely right for all the people; because the majority of criminals think that they will never be cought, So; we have to invent somenthing else, At the other hand; there are a lot of ways to reduce crime in the modern society, The alternative ways to do this consist of many strategies to rise the level of humans live and to turn the condition of their living to the better sight, For example; the government should give the sufficient ammount of work places; to devepol the educational system, The governmemnt have also to improve the economical; social and cultural domains, All these things can help to reduce the crime; because no one will want to steal or to kill someone in a successifull country with the total order in it, To sum it up; I can say that I prefer the second view; because I believe that all the people are good; and we can stop the crime before it will become a great problem,	1478	278	250+

Some of us believe that only the long prison sentences could fight the crime, They also think that killing prisoners for the hard issues those have made isn't a crime itself, MOre than this there are a certain amount of people wishing some of the prisoners to be killed, In the counties like muslim ones and in the some of the Amirican states it isn't a big deal and such thing happens quite often, But it does not goes along with the principle's of correct law, And in Europe such kind of things are prohibited as for residents and citizencs of the country and so for law institutes, The great exsample of minimalising the crime and judging thiths and killers properly is Sweden, There are the most comfortable prisons in the whole world, They look like a special cities with small houses where the prisoners live and work, The prisoners themselves are around to visit the city very the normal people live and shop there, NEvertheless; we can imagine the same in Russia, Prison is a very expensive institute to run, So we can put all of the prisoners in special settlent or even the simple; awful builings our country alreade have; so the new approches to reducing the crime should appeared, Maybe we should think about anti-unemployed politic; free education for everyone, Thus; things can get better and there will be no crime,	1599	282	250+

Prisons of Western world are tend to becoming more and more comfortable; providing prisoners television; books; some mind-occupaing work to do; good food and comfortable sleeping place, Critics argue that prisoners' conditions are too good; as they are living on citizens' taxes sometimes better than those citizens themselves, Can this hotel-like system be considered a punishement that leads to redemption? Some say that prison sentence must be as long as possible to force prisoners to otherthinking their behavior and evil deeds in such comfy conditions, They believe that the fear of long enough sentence will prevent people from commiting crimes as the risk will be not worth it, But such people are not looking at the core, They do not consider reasons that push people to crime, Most in prison are sentenced for robbery; drugs; domestic violence, All these crimes are caused mainly by poor economical and social conditions, It is very convinient for politisans to accuse poor people and portray them as maniacs who threaten wealthy middle class, I do believe that the best way to prevent crime is to work on people's level of life; spend more many not on army but on education and social serveses that can help people in crisis,	1795	297	250+

I personally think that people who share illegal music and film files are theviers, For example; lets take a look at worldwide news; the company "Pirate bay were serving free films; books; music; nowadays the owner of that company is in jail because of illegal sharing copies, It's a great example of bad outcome, Firstly; we need to support artists; by buying a film or CD; DVD we support people who do their job and; hence; as a result not supporting; helping crime business to grow, To prevent the work of lillegal pirate coping some companies started releasing an original CD's only at the authentical stories and some decided to fight with counterfeit by putting galagraghic sticker in production, The fight with counterfeit is crucial; if there are any ways of cutting-off pirates we need to support it by buing original copies, In Russia we have a planty amount of groups and people who fight with such problems, It is important not to only critisize the pirates but to support the authors by buing real CD's; investing personal money to author, All in all; the whole problem is accute and up to date -; partly because these days in the era of Internet people replace CD's with mp3's but frankly speaking; I came to the conclusion that we have to fight with all the pirate counterfeit in the most effective ways as it possible, It may seem an oldie but if you pay for every author job the world will chair,	1685	297	250+

If you considered others produce for free than you have to do the same thing work free? However; human's self-egoism wants only him being paid and others labor for free, Therefore; relasing piracy copies and downloading creators works for free form left online pages brings a great harm and even may prevent a future best products from occurring since creators are lost in the previous one and have no intentions to generate another one, Unfortunately; in our country the fight against piracy is not well established or well developed in the comparison with west countries such as EU or North America; In our dauly life we can be witness of many our friend who are occuped with piracy downloading of movies or music, From my perspective; we have to use soft power point of punishment and get people fined police for that actions that can be beneficial for both for the government and the producers of thus masterpieces,	1457	243	200+

So; a severe punishment can be extremely unfair, This is the reason why many people say that athletes should be banned only for a restricted period of time, I think that this view is far more fair and conscious, If an athlete is caught on using illegal drugs; he/she can have time to think about this problem, If an athlete is eager to return to professional competition; he/she will never use these drugs in future, As for me; I think that a strict punishment is not necessary, I agree withe the second point of view, If an athlete doesn't want to return to sport; he can do it,	1628	285	250+

So; often; it may indeed be not a desire of sportsmen to use illegal drugs; but opression by the government forces, Others; evidently; do not assume that it is possible and demand wronged sportsmen to be banned for the rest of their lives, This point of view may be understanded, Because unfairness is indeed a sad problem, And it should be punished, But from my point of view; there cannot be a simple yes or no decision, Every crime is unique, And as I mentioned afterwards of some powerfull structures interference, To conclude; I would like to underline one more time emphasis of principle; that every evidence is unique and should be judged very carefully,	1612	265	250+

By my opinion; if architect want to build something what will stay in history for a long time; he build something not tipical; interesting and he works with art; to create something beutiful; and sometimes can forget about how long it will be saved, For example; the building in the Rome; were people every day do a billion photos, But why? Because this bulding is very old and it serve its purpose; of corse; something is broken; but specialy this makes this building not tipical and interesting for people all around the world, In the modern world; architects try to create buildings for a long time, I think it's because they use a lot of time and money; and they try to do a good building which will serve for a long time, In our world we have a million talented architects which every day think about how to create something new; what nobody built, And i think that it's more important to built and create only good buldings which will serve for a hundred and more years; but it is important to not forget about this to look beauty and special; not like everything around us, It's too hard to be special and good architect in the world; were everyone of them wants to build something new; and to be in history like a great architect, But they shouldn't forget that they buildings should be not just beautiful; but and for a long time, 	1556	281	250+
