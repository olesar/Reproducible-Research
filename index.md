## Reproducible research

My work is in the areas of Slavic morphology, syntax, and lexicon, with focus on the interaction of their form and meaning. 
It employs methods of corpus linguistics, quantitative data analysis, natural language processing and modeling as well as 
techniques for constructing linguistic resources (corpora, dictionaries, constructicons, *nets, and databases).  

Here you can find open data for some of my projects and supplementary materials for my papers.
